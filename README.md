# VM
a playground like virtual desktop, inspired by ComputerCraft (minecraft mod), aims to bring a similar functionality to a standalone desktop app.
featuring a custom JS/XAML implementation, we use WPF as a front end, which allows for quick development of flexible UI. 

Note: This includes a VERY insecure local-network system, and you should only use it at your own risk.
It features the ability to upload/download directories and files to a 'server', which is hosted on your local network.
