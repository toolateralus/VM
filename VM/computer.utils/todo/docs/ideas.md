### command prompt
- we can make the command prompt function more like an actual
interactive command prompt, where we can read/write to the console to make interactive apps like installers/searchers
---
---
### operating system
- generally `clarify/reduce/improve` all the functions of the operating system, and make them more unanimously available and accessible to the various places they could be utilized.

- we should make the app installing process a more concrete/permanent one

- we should allow a `restart` command so you can reload the entire computer that it's called from. this kinda goes with the first point in this section.
---
---
### computer window / GUI 
- We should really try and decouple the actual behavior of the computer and the UI completely, utilizing dependency properties, observable collections, and other thread safety mechanisms from 
WPF, so that we can just handle everything in various classes from within the computer.
---
---
- We REALLY need to re work the resizing/window move behavior, also add a context menu to the taskbar icons
- We should also probably just make a Task Manager style app in js.

### file structure
- we should have the javascript syntax highlighting get loaded from utils/js_syntax_highlighting.xshd
