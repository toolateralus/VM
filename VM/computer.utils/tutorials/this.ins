This file enables **Quick Booting**, allowing for faster startup and bypassing the creation menu.

**Quick Booting**:
- When activated, this computer will directly start without displaying the menu to open new computers by index.
- To revert, rename or delete this file.

**Important**:
- Placing this file within a `computer` directory designates it for Quick Booting.
- Moving it outside or having duplicate `this.ins` files may lead to errors. Keep a single copy active at once, if any, and keep that copy within a computer's file structure to avoid complications.
